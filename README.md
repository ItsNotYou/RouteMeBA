RouteMe: The pervasive learning game for MANETs
-----------------------------------------------

This abstract is a copy of the corresponding paper [RouteMe â€“ Routing in Ad-hoc-Netzen als pervasives Lernspiel][routeme-paper]:

Field Trips are a well established approach to link learning content to real world experiences beyond lecture rooms. Thus, they are a popular method to achieve a persistent knowledge transfer in several disciplines. To some extent, computer science education lacks in such methods as many aspects of the field are theoretical, virtual, and focused on processes. But meantime, pervasive technologies can be used to realize field trips in an augmented and virtual manner. This article introduces the pervasive learning game RouteMe that maps ad hoc networks on real world environments and invites playing learners to an interactive excursion into the world of dynamic routing protocols.
